======================

== NAME

localsearch-extract - Extract metadata from a file.

== SYNOPSYS

*localsearch extract* _FILE_

== DESCRIPTION

*localsearch extract* reads the file provided and extracts any metadata it
can from this file, then displays the metadata on standard output.

The metadata is displayed as RDF data, equivalent to the data inserted in
the indexer database relative to the extracted file metadata. This RDF data
can feasibly be imported in a compatible triple store.

The actual metadata extraction is done by a separate sandboxed process.

  Choose which format to use to output results. Supported formats are
  _turtle_, _trig_ and _json-ld_.

== EXAMPLES

Using command line to extract metadata from a file:::

$ localsearch extract /path/to/some/file.mp3

== ENVIRONMENT

*LOCALSEARCH_DEBUG*::
  Enables more specialized debug output. Pass a comma-separated
  list of one or more keywords:
    config::: extractor configuration
    statistics::: show statistics about how many files were processed
