localsearch-search(1)
=====================

== NAME

localsearch-search - Search for content by type or across all types

== SYNOPSIS

*localsearch search* [_options_...] [_resource-type_] <search-terms>

== DESCRIPTION

*localsearch search* searches all indexed content for the given search terms. Results are returned in ascending order.

_<search-terms>_::
  One or more words to search for. When multiple terms are provided,
  the default operation is a logical AND. For logical OR operations,
  see *-r*.
+
If no search terms are supplied but a _resource-type_ is given (like
*--folders* for example), then ALL items in that category are
returned.

Only resources which currently exist will be returned by this command
(see *--all* for more information).

== RESOURCE TYPES

*-f, --files*::
  Search for files of any type matching _search-terms_.
*-s, --folders*::
  Search for folders matching _search-terms_.
*-m, --music*::
  Search for music files matching _search-terms_.
*--music-albums*::
  Search for music albums matching _search-terms_.
*--music-artists*::
  Search for music artists matching _search-terms_.
*-i, --images*::
  Search for images matching _search-terms_.
*-v, --videos*::
  Search for videos matching _search-terms_.
*-t, --documents*::
  Search for documents matching _search-terms_.
*--software*::
  Search for software files matching _search-terms_.

== OPTIONS

*-l, --limit=<__limit__>*::
  Limit search to _limit_ results.
*-o, --offset=<__offset__>*::
  Offset the search results by _offset_. For example, start at item
  number 10 in the results. The default is 0.
*-r, --or-operator*::
  Use OR for search terms instead of AND (the default)
*-d, --detailed*::
  Show the unique URN associated with each search result. This does not
  apply to --music-albums and --music-artists.
*-a, --all*::
  Show results which might not be available. This might bebecause a
  removable media is not mounted for example. Without this option,
  resources are only shown if they exist. This option applies to all
  resource types except for `--music-artists`.
*--disable-snippets*::
  Results are shown with snippets. Snippets are context around the word
  that was searched for in the first place. This gives some idea of if
  the resource found is the right one. Snippets require Full Text Search
  to be compile time enabled AND to not be disabled with --disable-fts.
  Using --disable-snippets only shows the resources which matched, no
  context is provided about where the match occurred.
*--disable-fts*::
  If Full Text Search (FTS) is available, this option allows it to be
  disabled for one off searches. This returns results slightly using
  particular properties to match the search terms (like "nie:title")
  instead of looking for the search terms amongst ALL properties. It is
  more limiting to do this, but sometimes searching without FTS can
  yield better results if the FTS ranking is off.
*--disable-color*::
  This disables any ANSI color use on the command line. By default this
  is enabled to make it easier to see results.
