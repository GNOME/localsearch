== DESCRIPTION

Tracker indexes content with daemon processes that run in the background.
The *localsearch daemon* command allows for control of these components.
This ranges from starting, stopping and killing processes to pausing and
resuming them.

In addition to all this, there are ways to follow or watch what is
happening in real time from a top level and right down where the SPARQL
commits are happening too.

If no arguments are provided this command will show the current status
of all Tracker data miners.

The data miners can be paused or resumed using this command and you can
also list miners running and available.

== OPTIONS

*-t, --terminate::
  Stops the indexer.
*-s, --start*::
  Starts the indexer.
*-f, --follow*::
  Follow status changes to daemons as they happen. This is a top level
  view of what is happening. You will see the name for each daemon and a
  state with the progress in that state.

This requires Ctrl+C to stop and return to the command line. Each new
status is put on a new line.

*-w, --watch=[_ontology_]*::
  Watch changes that happen to the database in real time. This requires
  Ctrl+C to stop and return to the command line.
