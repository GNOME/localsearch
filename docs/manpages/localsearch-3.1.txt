localsearch-3(1)
================

== NAME

localsearch-3 - Filesystem indexer.

== SYNOPSIS

*localsearch-3* [_OPTION_...]

== DESCRIPTION

*localsearch-3* is not supposed to be run by the user since it is
started by its .desktop file when the user logs in. It can also be
started manually of course for debugging purposes. You can not run more
than one instance of this at the same time.

*localsearch-3* mines information about applications and files only.

== OPTIONS

*-?, --help*::
  Show summary of options.
*-V, --version*::
  Returns the version of this binary.
*-s, --initial-sleep=SECONDS*::
  Sets the initial sleep time before crawling the file system is
  started. If the *--no-daemon* option is used, this option is ignored.
*-n, --no-daemon*::
  Tells the indexer to exit once all indexing has finished and the
  database is up to date. This is not the default mode of operation for
  the indexer, usually it stays around acting like a daemon to monitor
  file updates which may occur over time. This option renders the
  *--initial-sleep* option moot.
*-e, --eligible=FILE*::
  Checks if *FILE* is eligible for being mined based on the current
  configuration rules. In addition to this, it will check if *FILE*
  would be monitored for changes. This works with non-existing *FILE*
  arguments as well as existing *FILE* arguments.
