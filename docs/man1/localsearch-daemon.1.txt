== NAME

localsearch-daemon - Start and stop the indexer

== SYNOPSIS

....
localsearch daemon [options...]
....

== DESCRIPTION

LocalSearch indexes content via a daemon process that runs in the background.
The *localsearch daemon* subcommand allows for control of this component.

In addition to this, there are ways to follow indexing status updates and
watching database updates as they happen.

If no arguments are provided this command will show the current status
of the LocalSearch indexer.

== OPTIONS

*-t, --terminate*::
  Stops the indexer.
*-s, --start*::
  Starts the indexer.
*-f, --follow*::
  Follow status changes to daemons as they happen. This is a top level
  view of what is happening. You will see the name for each daemon and a
  state with the progress in that state. This requires Ctrl+C to stop
  and return to the command line.
*-w, --watch*::
  Watch changes that happen to the database in real time. This requires
  Ctrl+C to stop and return to the command line.
